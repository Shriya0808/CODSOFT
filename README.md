CODSOFT Data Science Internship Tasks Description

Task 3 : Iris Flower Classification
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. We have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Our objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species. The Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

Task 4 : Sales Prediction using Python
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.

Task 5 : Credit Card Fraud Detection 
Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
